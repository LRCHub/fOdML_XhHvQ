One, two, one, two

I wish I saved up for rainy days, 'cause they're the hardest to be dry
I got no self-control, I'm always begging into telephones
And then I, I bought a little from a brother's friend
Yeah, it was just to get me by, I don't trust his cut
The effects never as high as the mark-up

I think I'll print it in the personals that I'm looking for a match
Someone to light me up
Someone to burn the proof of the things that I've done

Each day, there's hours I skip like a stone
I just crawl in a bag
I wanna live my life like somebody's shadow

I know I'm lazy with the little things, I mean I never held a door
But I still loved you more than anyone since, or before
You're always saying that I owe you one, well, let's consolidate this debt
Get on a payment plan, I'll pay you compliments, you keep on treating me bad
But now it's, now it's easy getting easier to leave you and this town behind
I'll do some traveling, once I'm gone, tell all our friends you got even

I'm held like an object and then set aside
I'm, I'm back on the shelf
I'm, I'm locked in the drawer
I'm, I'm mint in the box, but you'd still
You'd sell me for cost, wouldn't you?

(And I'll be anything) the cord of a parachute
(And I'll be anything) the blanket on top of you
(oh, I'll be anything) the window you're looking through
(And I'll be anything) the cord of a parachute
(Oh, I'll be anything) the cord of a parachute
The cord of a parachute
